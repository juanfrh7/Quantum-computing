    "**HIV is a virus that has presented an immense challenge for public health, globally**. The ensuing disease dynamics touch on multiple societal dimensions including nutrition, access to health, education and research funding. To compound the difficulties, the virus mutates rapidly with different strains having different geographic footprints. In particular, the HIV-1-C and HIV-2 strains predominate mostly in Africa. Due to disparities in funding, research for treatments of the African strains lags behind other programmes. African researchers are striving to address this imbalance and should consider adding the latest technologies such as quantum computing to their toolkits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantum computing promises spectacular improvements in drug-design**. In particular, in order to design new anti-retrovirals it is important to perform **chemical simulations** to confirm that the anti-retroviral binds with the virus protein. Such simulations are notoriously hard and sometimes ineffective on classical supercomputers. Quantum computers promise more accurate simulations allowing for a better drug-design workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In detail: anti-retrovirals are drugs that bind with and block a virus protein, called protease, that cleaves virus polyproteins into smaller proteins, ready for packaging. The protease can be thought of as a chemical scissor. The anti-retroviral can be thought of as a sticky obstacle that disrupts the ability of the scissor to cut. With the protease blocked, the virus cannot make more copies of itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutations in the viral protease changes the binding propensity of a given anti-retroviral. Hence, when a mutation occurs and an anti-retroviral no longer binds well, the goal becomes to adjust the anti-retroviral molecule to again bind strongly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The main goal of this challenge is to explore whether a toy anti-retroviral molecule binds with a toy virus protease.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, this challenge introduces **state-of-the-art hybrid classical-quantum embedded chemistry modelling** allowing the splitting of the work-load between classical approximations and more accurate quantum calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you need to tweak the setup of the quantum chemistry algorithm (without having to understand the nuts and bolts of quantum computing) to achieve the best performance for ideal quantum computing conditions."

    "The agreement to so many decimal places tells us that, for this particular Hamiltonian, the VQE process is accurately finding the lowest eigenvalue (and interestingly, the ansatz/trial does not fail to capture the ground-state, probably because it spans the entire Hilbert space). However, when comparing to nature or very accurate classical simulations of $H_2$, we find that the energy is only accurate to two decimal places, e.g. total energy VQE: -1.137 Hartree vs highly accurate classical simulation: -1.166 Hartree, which only agrees two decimal places. The reason for this is that in our above treatment there are sources of modelling error including: the placement of nuclei and a number of approximations that come with the Hartree-Fock expansion. For $H_2$ these can be addressed, but ultimately, in general, the more tricky of these sources can never be fully handled because finding the perfect ground-state is QMA-complete, i.e. the quantum version of NP-complete (i.e. 'unsolvable' for certain Hamiltonians). Then again, nature itself is not expected to be finding this perfect ground-state, so future experimention is needed to see how close a given quantum computing solution approximates nature's solution."

    "In Step 2, we constructed the qubit Hamiltonian. If we tried to apply Step 2 and beyond to our macromolecule above, the ground state calculation simulation would fail. The reason is because since we specified a zero charge, Qiskit knows that it must work with 30 (= 2\\*6+7+8+3\\*1) electrons. After second quantization, this translates into, say, 60 spin-orbitals which requires 60 qubits. 60 qubits is beyond our ability to simulate classically and while there are IBM Quantum systems with more than 60 qubits available, the noise levels are currently too high to produce accurate results when using that many qubits. Thus, for the purpose of this Challenge we need to reduce the number of qubits. Fortunately, this is well-motivated from a chemistry point of view as well: the classical Hartree-Fock approximation for core-electrons is sometimes sufficient to obtain accurate chemical results. Doubly fortunately, Qiskit has just recently been extended to seamlessly allow for users to specify that certain electrons should receive quantum-computing treatment while the remaining electrons should be classically approximated. Even as more qubits come on online, this facility may prove very useful in allowing near-term quantum computers to tackle very large molecules that would otherwise be out of reach."

    "For extra intuition, you may think of the energy landscape as a mountain, next to a valley, next to a plateau that a ball rolls on (the x co-ordinate of the ball corresponds the separation between the two hydrogen atoms). If the ball is not rolling too fast down the plateau (right to left) it may settle in the valley. The ball slowly rolls down the plateau because the slope is positive (representing a force of attraction between the two hydrogen atoms). If the ball overshoots the minimum point of the valley, it meets the steep negative slope of the mountain and quickly rolls back (the hydrogen atoms repell each other).\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the minimum is at zero. This is because we defined the hydrogen molecule's nuclei positions at the known ground state positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, if we had used the hardware_inspired_trial we would have produced a similiar plot, however it would have had bumps because the anzatz does not capture the electronic ground state equally well at different bond lengths."
